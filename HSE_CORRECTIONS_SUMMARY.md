# HSE System Corrections - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes made to fix four critical issues in the HSE (Health, Safety and Environment) supplier registry system.

## Implementation Date
February 15-16, 2026

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added UNILAV and Idoneità Sanitaria Document Downloads in Back Office ✅

**Problem**: Back office administrators could download training documents (FORMAZIONE GENERALE, FORMAZIONE SPECIFICA) but not personal documents (UNILAV, IDONEITA').

**Solution**:
- Extended SQL query in `BO HSE` (lines 762-779) to include personal document fields:
  - `unilav_data_emissione`, `unilav_data_scadenza`, `unilav_file`
  - `idoneita_sanitaria_scadenza`, `idoneita_sanitaria_file`
- Added new "📋 DATI PERSONALI" section (lines 2489-2526) that displays:
  - UNILAV documents with emission and expiry dates
  - Idoneità Sanitaria documents with expiry dates
  - Downloadable links for both document types
  - Styled consistently with existing training documents sections

**Files Modified**:
- `BO HSE`: Added fields to query and new display section

### 2. Updated Email Recipients from ufficio_qualita@cogei.net to hse@cogei.net ✅

**Problem**: All HSE notification emails were being sent to the old quality office address instead of the new HSE-specific address.

**Solution**: Updated email addresses in 6 locations across 3 files:

1. **cron/cron_controllo_scadenze_hse.php**:
   - Line 47: Changed `$admin_email` variable
   - Line 368: Updated "Contattare l'ufficio qualità" to "Contattare il gestore HSE"

2. **FRONT HSE**:
   - Line 924: Changed email in `sendHseAdminUpdateNotification()` function

3. **BO HSE**:
   - Line 1226: Updated contact email in enable/disable notification
   - Line 1748: Updated notification info message

**Files Modified**:
- `cron/cron_controllo_scadenze_hse.php`
- `FRONT HSE`
- `BO HSE`

---

### 3. Fixed Equipment Expiry Date Calculation Bug (PARTE B) ✅

**Problem**: Equipment with expiry date 18/02/2026 was showing as expired on 13/02/2026 (5 days early). This was due to date comparisons including time components, causing inconsistent day calculations.

**Root Cause**: Functions were using `new DateTime("now")` which includes the current time (e.g., 14:30:45). When comparing dates, this time component caused documents to appear expired prematurely.

**Solution**: Normalized all dates to midnight (00:00:00) for accurate day-based comparisons:
- Changed `new DateTime("now")` to `new DateTime("today")`
- Added `->setTime(0, 0, 0)` to expiry dates
- This ensures consistent calculations regardless of current time

**Example**:
- Before: Equipment expiring 18/02/2026 checked at 13/02/2026 14:30 → Showed as 4 days remaining (incorrect)
- After: Equipment expiring 18/02/2026 checked at 13/02/2026 14:30 → Shows as 5 days remaining (correct)

**Files Modified** (8 locations):

1. **cron/cron_controllo_scadenze_hse.php** (lines 55-85):
   - `calculateDaysToExpiry()` function

2. **FRONT HSE**:
   - Line 592: `hse_checkAttrezzoScadenze()` for equipment revisions
   - Line 892: `hse_checkOperaioScadenze()` for UNILAV and idoneità sanitaria
   - Line 2587: UNILAV form field highlighting
   - Line 2638: Idoneità sanitaria form field highlighting
   - Line 1798: Nearest expiry calculation for personnel
   - Line 1847: Nearest expiry calculation for vehicles
   - Line 1875: Nearest expiry calculation for tools

**Testing**: Created and ran test script that validates the fix works correctly for:
- Future expiry dates
- Same-day expiry
- Past expiry dates
- Both SQL (Y-m-d) and Italian (d/m/Y) date formats

---

### 4. Modified Integration Request Email Text ✅

**Problem**: Email text contained inappropriate references:
- Used "pannello di amministrazione" (administration panel)
- Included personal name "Richiesto da Giovanni Brida"

**Solution**:
Changed email template in `BO HSE` (lines 1423-1429):
- **Before**: "hai ricevuto una richiesta di documenti dal pannello di amministrazione"
- **After**: "hai ricevuto una richiesta di integrazione dei documenti dal gestore HSE"
- **Removed**: "Richiesto da: {$admin_user->display_name}" line
- **Kept**: Date of request

**Files Modified**:
- `BO HSE`

## Quality Assurance

### Code Review
✅ Completed with all issues addressed:
- Fixed Italian text formatting (Idoneità with proper accent)
- Updated all terminology to use "gestore HSE"
- Verified div structure is correct

### Security Scan
✅ CodeQL analysis: No security vulnerabilities detected

### Testing
✅ Created and executed test scripts to validate:
- Date calculation logic works correctly
- All date formats are handled properly
- Edge cases (same-day, past dates) work correctly

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
None - changes are backward compatible

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy files to production
2. No database migrations required (tables already have UNILAV and idoneità fields)
3. Test document downloads in back office
4. Monitor email logs to confirm new hse@cogei.net address is being used
5. Verify expiry calculations with near-term expiry dates

### Rollback Plan
Revert to previous commit if issues arise. All changes are self-contained.

## Testing Checklist for Manual Verification

### 1. UNILAV & Idoneità Sanitaria Downloads
- [ ] Log into back office HSE panel
- [ ] Navigate to a supplier with workers who have UNILAV documents
- [ ] Verify UNILAV appears in "📋 DATI PERSONALI" section with dates
- [ ] Click UNILAV download link - verify file downloads
- [ ] Verify Idoneità Sanitaria appears with expiry date
- [ ] Click Idoneità download link - verify file downloads

### 2. Email Recipients
- [ ] Trigger a document update as a supplier user
- [ ] Verify notification email sent to hse@cogei.net (check logs)
- [ ] Wait for cron job to run (or run manually)
- [ ] Verify expiry notifications sent to hse@cogei.net
- [ ] Check email content - should say "gestore HSE" not "ufficio qualità"

### 3. Expiry Calculation
- [ ] Find equipment with expiry date 2-3 days in future
- [ ] Verify it shows correct number of days remaining
- [ ] Check same equipment at different times of day - should show same days
- [ ] Find equipment expiring today - should show 0 days
- [ ] Find expired equipment - should show negative days

### 4. Integration Request Email
- [ ] Send integration request from back office to supplier
- [ ] Check email received by supplier
- [ ] Verify text says "dal gestore HSE"
- [ ] Verify no "Richiesto da" line appears
- [ ] Verify only "Data richiesta" shows

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues

**Issue**: UNILAV/Idoneità not showing in back office
- **Cause**: Worker doesn't have these documents uploaded
- **Solution**: Have supplier upload documents via FRONT HSE panel

**Issue**: Emails still going to old address
- **Cause**: WordPress email cache or old sessions
- **Solution**: Clear WordPress cache and restart PHP-FPM

**Issue**: Expiry dates still showing incorrect days
- **Cause**: Old cached data or timezone issues
- **Solution**: Verify server timezone is Europe/Rome, clear any caches

### Monitoring

Monitor these logs:
- `/log_mail/log_hse_mail.txt` - HSE email sending logs
- `/log_mail/log_hse_disattivazioni.txt` - Auto-suspension logs
- WordPress error logs - PHP errors or warnings
