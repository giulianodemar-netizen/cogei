# HSE Bug Fixes - README

## 📋 Overview

This pull request fixes two critical bugs in the HSE supplier registry system:

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Button Click Not Working (FRONT HSE)
- ✅ Added unique ID to button
- ✅ Added z-index for proper layering
- ✅ Added debug logging
- ✅ Prevented accordion interference with button clicks

### Issue 2: Missing Unassigned Items (BO HSE)
- ✅ Now shows ALL automezzi (assigned + unassigned)
- ✅ Now shows ALL attrezzi (assigned + unassigned)
- ✅ Visual distinction: assigned items = colored, unassigned = gray
- ✅ Badges: "✓ Assegnato" (green) vs "⚪ Non assegnato" (gray)

## 🎨 Visual Guide

### Assigned Items
```
🚛 Fiat Ducato [✓ Assegnato]  ← Yellow background
